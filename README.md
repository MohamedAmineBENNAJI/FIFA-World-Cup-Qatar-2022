### Overview: <a name="overview"></a>
<br>

In this project, I worked on predicting the winner of the group-stage games using a multi-class classifier that uses multiple data sources to classify game results into 3 categories (Home,Draw, and Away).

I also wrote an [article](https://medium.com/@aminebenneji/world-cup-qatar-2022-group-stage-winners-you-didnt-know-about-d720fed4d98f) on **Medium** where I detailed the steps to implement this project and listed the results that I got.



### Installation:  <a name="installation"></a>
<br>

1. First you need to clone the repository to your local machine using this command:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/aminebennaji19/FIFA-World-Cup-Qatar-2022.git
    ```

2. After cloning the repository, you need to install the install the project requirements.

- **PS**: This project was developed using **Python3.7**
    
    ```
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Results <a name="results"></a>
<br>

In this project:

- We Explored, pre-processed and prepared the data to use following the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process.

- We Trained, evaluated, tested and optimized the classifier on test data and a held-out test split (world cup games).
- We Fine-tuned the model to improve its performance.
- We Predicted the winners of the group stage phase.

Take a look at this [blog](https://medium.com/@aminebenneji/world-cup-qatar-2022-group-stage-winners-you-didnt-know-about-d720fed4d98f) to understand what we did in details and also on the code implementation.


### Next steps: <a name="next"></a>
<br>

The results that we had are the very first results and can be improved in the near future by one of these potential solutions:

- Add, and clean more data where we can study the outliers, and the skewness of the data and consider the balance of the classes.
Use more potential data sources like the latest player stats to include performance indicators for each team.

- Include the already-played game results of the group stage of this edition into the training set maybe theyâ€™ll add something beneficial to conclude the World Cup winner.

- Deploy this work on a web application to showcase its added value.

This project is the final part of the [**Udacity Data Science Nanodegree program**](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025?utm_source=gsem_brand&utm_medium=ads_r&utm_campaign=12949497746_c_individuals&utm_term=130336578188&utm_keyword=data%20scientist%20nanodegree_e&gclid=Cj0KCQiAgribBhDkARIsAASA5bvkUHaXzaZyn66isK3HJReKaCFeYsvd6tCYfnhLYGFRGuv1KEiW69kaAh9kEALw_wcB) that is really helpful and practical. I would like to dedicate this work to [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) for sharing the data and findings between members and make everything possible by unlocking the hidden secrets of data.
